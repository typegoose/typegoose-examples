## Removed Plugins

### mongoose-delete

Currently mongoose-delete does not work with typegoose because the types are incompatible with current mongoose types, also the plugin only lists mongoose versions `4 5 6` as supported.

Removal commit is [03b5998ca9631d21b042728715c38a174fac2afc](https://github.com/typegoose/typegoose-examples/commit/03b5998ca9631d21b042728715c38a174fac2afc).
